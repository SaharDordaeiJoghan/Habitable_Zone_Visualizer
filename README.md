# Habitable Zone Visualizer

A Python tool to visualize **habitable zones (HZ)** around main-sequence stars (M, K, G, F, A types). This script shows how both **conservative** and **optimistic** HZ ranges vary across spectral types using a horizontal bar chart.

---

## What It Does

- Uses accepted scientific data (Kopparapu et al. 2013, 2014) for both **conservative** and **optimistic** HZ boundaries.
- Plots a horizontal bar chart of the HZ range for five types of stars.
- Labels each bar with its spectral type (M to A).
- Saves a high-resolution plot as `habitable_zone_comparison.png`.

## Scientific Notes

- The **Habitable Zone (HZ)** is defined as the region around a star where liquid water could exist on a planetâ€™s surface.
- Two HZ models are shown:
  - **Conservative**: Based on stricter assumptions for Earth-like conditions.
  - **Optimistic**: Extends boundaries based on Venus/Mars historical conditions.
- Based on widely accepted models:
  - Kopparapu et al. (2013, 2014), with temperature classes taken from stellar models.
